# Jensen Bouzi's Personal Site

## About
This is my personal website that contains information about myself, some projects I've worked on, 
a brief overview of my skills, and means to contact me. It was built with HTML5, CSS3, and some JavaScript. 

##Future Goals
I plan to expand this site to incorporate a blog feature and continue to optimize the current content. 
I am currently in the process of researching the frameworks and technologies that I'd like to use to
accomplish these goals.
