           <h2>What is Pair Programming?</h2>
           <p>Pair programming is when two programmers collaborate on a project, in which one drives or writes down the code
               and the other navigates or reviews each line of code, guiding the entire process.

           <h2>Why is Pair Programming important to DBC?</h2>
           <p>Pair Programming is important to DBC for several reasons, the most important reason is that it allows different programmers
               within the DBC program to get to know eachother and learn to communicate with each other about coding. Another reason it is
               important to DBC is because it is becoming a more common practice amongst programmers everywhere and DBC wants us to start
               doing it now so we know how it works. It also helps avoid mistakes and ensures more efficient coding.

           <h2>Driver vs. Navigator</h2>
           <p>In pair programming, the driver types while the navigator leads the driver, essentially guiding the entire coding process.
               The driver may give input, but mainly must focus on the area of code instructed by the navigator.
