          <h1>CONFLICT RESOLUTION</h1>
            <img src="../imgs/compass_shame.gif">
            <p>When confronted with conflict, each person digests the experience differently, choosing healthy or unhealthy responses based on their personalities and personal perceptions. Dr. L. Nathanson organized an interesting concept called &apos;The Compass of Shame,&apos; which is the visual manifestation of the different responses to shame, yet I believe it can also be applied to conflict as well. The main behaviors include withdrawal, attacking self, attacking other, and avoidance.  These behaviors are not healthy or mature reactions to shame, but are defense mechanisms for dealing with such emotions. I believe that this is the case for conflict as well. Conflict often originates from disparities between individuals, including differing values, perceptions, styles, goals, resources, pressures, or other differences. </p>
            <p>In my experience, I tended to avoid conflict, so I would probably fall within the withdrawal side of the compass. I often removed myself from the situation or detached myself from the person when conflict starts to arise. In many instances, I&apos;ve quelled parts of my personality, ideals, or opinions in order to prevent any initial conflict with someone, until I feel comfortable enough around them. This may stem from my desire to prevent anyone from experiencing discomfort while they are in my presence, but in the process I make myself uncomfortable. I&apos;ve come to realize that I must confront conflicts tactfully, and fight against this tendency to withdraw. Expressing my emotions, especially when dealing with people I don&apos;t know very well, is crucial for my personal development and confidence. Having the maturity and confidence to speak my mind candidly during times of conflict will prevent miscommunication, being taken advantage of, and open doors for others to truly get to know my true self and values. </p>
