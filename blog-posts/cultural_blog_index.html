          <h2>Asking The Right Questions</h2>
            <p>October 2,2014</p>
            <p>When you get stuck on a problem, forgot how certain language-specific syntactical elements work, or wish to compare solutions to similar problems, sites like <a href=”http://stackoverflow.com/”>Stack Overflow</a> are the perfect resource to get some of questions answered. Throughout my time increasing my developer skills over the past few weeks, I&apos;ve learned that asking the right questions when researching online is just as crucial as getting your questions answered...</p>

          <h2>Website Overhaul</h2>
            <p>September 28,2014</p>
            <p>Three days and countless reformatting strategies later, and I&apos;ve finally revamped my website. I created an entirely new format for my contact, about-me, and projects pages while implementing a separate yet similar format for my blog pages. I&apos;m still unsure about my vision for my index page, so I&apos;ve decided to leave it unchanged for now. I see this site as a continuous project that will continue to transform and grow as I learn about new technologies while at DBC...</p>

          <h2>Conflict Resolution</h2>
            <p>September 26,2014</p>
            <p>When confronted with conflict, each person digests the experience differently, choosing healthy or unhealthy responses based on their personalities and personal perceptions. Dr. L. Nathanson organized an interesting concept called &apos;The Compass of Shame,&apos; which is the visual manifestation of the different responses to shame, yet I believe it can also be applied to conflict as well...</p>

          <h2>Happiness, Affirmation, and Stereotype Threat</h2>
            <p>September 21,2014</p>
            <p> This week at DBC, we were asked to discuss some important values and how they relate to our sense of happiness and satisfaction. There were far too many values on the provided list to simply focus on one, and overall I believe that happiness may stem from many places. In my experience, I&apos;ve found tranquility, self-worth, and accomplishment to tremendously contribute to my greatest moments. These three may not necessarily be values, however, they are all arise in some way, shape, or form upon reflecting on my happiest, proudest, or most satisfying experiences...</p>

          <h2>Stereotype Threat</h2>
            <p>September 12,2014</p>
            <p> Stereotype threat was coined by social psychologist Dr. Claude Steele in a 1995 study that revealed that Black college freshman and sophomores performed more poorly on standardized tests than White students when their race was emphasized. The phrase refers to being at risk of confirming, as self-characteristic, a negative stereotype about one&apos;s group. It can also be interpreted as subconscious self-handicapping...</p>

          <h2>Dev Bootcamp Journey: Update</h2>
            <p>September 5,2014</p>
            <p> It is now 5 weeks into Phase-0 of my DBC journey and I must say that it has been a tremendous experience thus far. I&apos;ve learned more in these past few weeks than I would have in a few months on my own. In addition to being introduced to HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Ruby, a big proponent of DBC is pair work and feedback. We are all required to pair with another student each week and administer feedback after every pairing session. Since web development and other careers in tech are very collaborative (contrary to popular belief), this is an imperative aspect of DBC...</p>

          <h2>Silicon Valley Must Look in the Mirror</h2>
            <p>August 31,2014</p>
            <p> The lack of diversity in the tech industry has been a well-known issue, yet one that many tend to shy away from. In attempts to most likely preserve their image, companies tend to conceal their employment statistics. Back in May, Google attempted to address this lack of transparency from Silicon Valley by publishing a breakdown of their workforce by gender and ethnicity, and the results weren&apos;t too pretty...</p>

          <h2>My Thinking Style</h2>
            <p>August 16,2014</p>
            <p>Order and randomness hardly seem like two concepts that can be combined into one entity. However, the human mind is extremely complex and capable of the most magnificent feats. When researching my thinking style, I never would have anticipated my thought process implementing both. According to Gregoric&apos; mind styles model, my thinking style is two-fold; abstract random (AR) and abstract sequential (AS). Now lets unpack this...</p>

          <h2>Kitchen v.s. Restaurant</h2>
            <p>August 10,2014</p>
            <p>Before beginning my Dev Bootcamp experience, I never truly sat down and contemplated how rigorous my upcoming experience will be. I typically try to set high goals for my self, create a flexible plan of action, and attempt to execute no matter the difficulty. If I have a goal in mind or if I want a certain type of experience I honestly do not care how challenging it may be. As a result I tend to not think about the gravity of such challenges... </p>
