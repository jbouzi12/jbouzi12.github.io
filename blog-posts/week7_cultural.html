      <h1>Happiness, Affirmation, and Stereotype Threat</h1>
      <hr width="95%"></hr><br></br>
      <p>This week at DBC, we were asked to discuss some important values and how they relate to our sense of happiness and satisfaction. There were far too many values on the provided list to simply focus on one, and overall I believe that happiness may stem from many places. In my experience, I&apos;ve found tranquility, self-worth, and accomplishment to tremendously contribute to my greatest moments. These three may not necessarily be values, however, they are all arise in some way, shape, or form upon reflecting on my happiest, proudest, or most satisfying experiences. </p>

      <p>Due to my introverted tendencies and shy nature, I always feel the need to fall back into a mental space where I can reflect and sort through my thoughts. Certain events, occurrences, or behaviors can weigh heavily on me so alone time is key for me to sort through them in order to make sense of them. When I am able to find tranquility, I feel free from the weight of my thoughts and emotions. In those moments I believe that I can accomplish everything, and I am able to truly step back from my life to appreciate all of my blessings. Growing up while going through some difficult periods in terms of confidence, I found music to offer me tremendous tranquility, propelling me to overcome. In those moments I reach vital epiphanies, guiding me toward personal growth. I also find tranquility when playing soccer, and especially through certain relationships in my life. When I reach tranquility, I&apos;m able to learn more about myself and strengthen my self-worth. Self-worth is extremely important to me; it is what helps me secure happiness no matter what circumstances I find myself in, and pushes me to achieve great things.  My knowledge of self develops the more I learn, so it is tied to movement. Constantly having movement in my life drives me to continue to set high goals and work toward those goals. Movement can mean taking advantage of opportunities, traveling in order to expand my mind, or educating myself on topics that I know little of. These values help me to achieve balance, persistent growth, and affirm my capabilities. I try to live up to them each day, although at times I may waver. On a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being disagree and 5 being agree) my estimation of how I live up to these values is as follows: tranquility (3), self-worth (5), movement (4). </p>

      <p>Recently, my brother asked for career advice, specifically job application strategies. I like when people consult me for any type of advice because I enjoy breaking down problems with them help them attain a positive end result. Growth is important to me, so I make sure that I am able to contribute to his or her growth whenever someone reaches out to me for anything. I offered him some tips on how to make his search more efficient, but told him to focus on creating a path for himself with an end goal and most importantly to never settle.  Setting goals will help you gain clarity on which positions or companies to view, and help you pin point what you are truly passionate about. But knowing your worth will prevent you from ever settling especially when you know you can achieve more. I hope this helped him along his career path. </p>

      <p>Last week I discussed stereotype threat and how it affects us all. I believe that holding onto your core values can definitely help you mediate stereotype threat. When encountering stereotype threat, reminding yourself of your value as an individual can motivate you to perform to the best of your ability, and make optimal life decisions no matter what prejudices are out there. </p>
