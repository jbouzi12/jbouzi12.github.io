          <h1>Website Overhaul<h1>
            <p>Three days and countless reformatting strategies later, and I&apos;ve finally revamped my website. I created an entirely new format for my contact, about-me, and projects pages while implementing a separate yet similar format for my blog pages. I&apos;m still unsure about my vision for my index page, so I&apos;ve decided to leave it unchanged for now. I see this site as a continuous project that will continue to transform and grow as I learn about new technologies while at DBC. </p>

            <p>I chose to transform the site mainly by editing my existing CSS and HTML files. I do plan to implement some JavaScript to my homepage to add some cool animation, however, I would rather do so once I complete my vision for it. In addition, I considered incorporating Jekyll onto the site as well, however, considering Jekyll&apos;s learning curve and the considerable number of hours I already up to that point, I chose to hold off on this as well. I certainly see the merits of Jekyll, so I will most likely set time aside in the near future to learn and eventually use it for my site.</p>

            <p>I showed my site to a few friends and family members for some feedback, all of whom really liked my new layout. Yet it was difficult to get some serious, constructive feedback when they themselves don&apos;t really understand or pay attention to website layouts. So I found that they were liked that I was able to make a website, but couldn&apos;t differentiate whether or not it was professional grade. As a result I relied heavily on some of the websites that I&apos;ve used as inspiration over the past few weeks. My main objectives were to create a much simpler layout/color scheme and have a fixed header with all the content scrolling below it. I wanted the blog pages to have a different color scheme than the main pages such that visitors would get a visual reminder that they are at a different section of my site. </p>

            <p>Initially when learning CSS and HTML, I struggled with fixed, relative, and absolute positioning, so creating a fixed header with a properly formatted body took hours to complete. Frustrations mounted especially when I encountered margin issues with certain pages. At times, pages with almost the exact same html/css layout would experience different margin results at certain parts. While debugging these issues I came up with new formatting strategies that I would then need to transfer to completed pages. Overall I&apos;m happy with the end product and feel much more confident in my ability to layer a web page and achieve a more fluid design. I&apos;m especially happy with the fixed headers and drop-down menu for the blog link. These were these were the most difficult to learn how to implement, but I was able to execute my desired vision. </p>
