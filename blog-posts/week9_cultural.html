                <h1>Asking The Right Questions</h1>

                <p>When you get stuck on a problem, forgot how certain language-specific syntactical elements work, or wish to compare solutions to similar problems, sites like <a href=”http://stackoverflow.com/”>Stack Overflow</a> are the perfect resource to get some of questions answered. Throughout my time increasing my developer skills over the past few weeks, I&apos;ve learned that asking the right questions when researching online is just as crucial as getting your questions answered. Developing this skill not only takes time, it is extremely important practice in this field. In this post I&apos;m going to discuss some tips that will help you formulate a good question, so that you can get great answers.
                    <p/>

                    <h3>Pretend that you are trying answer the question</h3>
                    <p>After writing your question, imagine revisiting it without any context. Some key questions to ask are is it clear? Is it easy to understand and makes sense? Are there any other key words that you would need before answering? This is fairly straight forward, but of course would be easier after having a certain amount of experience answering questions (participating often on Stack Overflow or some other forum).</p>

                    <h3>Question Title</h3>
                    <p>The question title is where you grab the eye of the reader
                        <strong>make it count</strong>. Here are a couple of things to make sure you check to ensure you have a good title:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Include information tags to help people who particularly pay attention to specific tags</li>
                        <li>Be as specific as possible (&apos;Please help&apos; won&apos;t get your post any attention)</li>
                        <li>Include error messages, key API&apos;s, programming language names, etc.</li>
                        <li>Spelling, grammar, and punctuation are important.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Context</h3>
                    <p>After grabbing their attention with a good question, potential answer providers need to know some background information in order to give you the most accurate answer possible. This includes language version, platform version, operating system (if relavant), software, and/or any constraints. In addition, describe the approach you already tried and the results of your research (which you should do before asking any question). Add you&apos;re code so the reader can visualize exactly what you are working with (not the entire code of course, just the part you are stuck on). Describe your goal, and results of your attempts and your thoughts behind them. For data-oriented questions, provide some sample data and how it should be organized based on your attempted solution.</p>
                    <h3>Respond to feedback</h3>
                    <p>After you&apos;ve proof read your question and are satisfied, post it, sit back, and wait for responses. On sites like Stack Overflow, it shouldn&apos;t take too long to receive feedback. If you don&apos;t, revisit your question and critically asses whether or not it makes sense or if you were leaving out any vital information and post it again. If not, be ready to respond to comments, providing new information when needed, and try out their suggestions in addition to giving them feedback on their methods.</p>
