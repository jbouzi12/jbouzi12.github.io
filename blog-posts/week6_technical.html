      <h1>Variable Scope</h1>
      <hr width="95%"></hr><br></br>
      <p>The main difference between Ruby variables relies in their scope. Scope defines where in which a variable is accessible in a program. Ruby contains five types of variables:  local variables, global variables, instance variables, class variables, and constants. Each of which vary in scope and declared using a special character at the start of the variable name. Ruby also has two variables that whose values can&apos;t be assigned. <strong>Nil</strong> is an object that has the bolean value of false and <strong>self</strong> is the currently executing object.</p>

      <p>Local variables are limited to the location in which they are declared. For instance, a local variable declared within a method or iteration can’t be accessed outside of that iteration or method. Global variables are much wider in their scope; they are accessible anywhere in a program. There probably won&apos;t ever be a time in which global variables would be useful because their scope makes them difficult to track; they can be viewed and changed anywhere in the program, so many would advise against their use.</p>

      <p>The class objects bind the scope of instance and class variables. Ruby class variables can be utilized amongst all instances of a class; one variable exists for all instances of this class. So if one object instance of the class changes the value of the variable, this value will be applied for all other object instances of that class. Instance variables function similarly, however, their scope is limited to specific instances of an object. If you were to create a class called &#8220Dog&#8221 with a variable called @name, then each instance of Dog will have local copies of @name. Any changes to @name will be limited to that instance of Dog.</p>

      <p>Constants work slightly differently than the other Ruby variables. As you may have guessed, their values should not be changed once assigned (contrary to most programming languages, Ruby allows you to change the value of a constant). This is not recommended, and your computer will most likely display a warning message if you do so.</p>
      <p>Overall, you should define variables in the smallest scope required to perform the desired task. If you need something to exist only within a function, use a local variable. If you need something to persist across function calls of a particular class, use an instance variable. If you need a variable that is shared between every instance of a class, use a class variable, although these cases are rare. </p>
