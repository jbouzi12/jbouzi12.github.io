      <h1>Stereotype Threat</h1>
      <hr width="95%"></hr><br></br>
      <p>Stereotype threat was coined by social psychologist Dr. Claude Steele in a 1995 study that revealed that Black college freshman and sophomores performed more poorly on standardized tests than White students when their race was emphasized. The phrase refers to being at risk of confirming, as self-characteristic, a negative stereotype about one&apos;s group. It can also be interpreted as subconscious self-handicapping. The fear revolves around personal identity contingencies, which can adversely affect performance in specific situations (e.g. academic performance of Black college students) and life defining choices of careers, relationships, regions of the country to live in, etc. </p>

      <p>The context in which identity is cultivated is key; how the society is organized around that identity and whether or not you have to deal with things because you are of that identity will become important to how you function daily. Essentially, these identities are broad stereotypes that societies have created (some of which decades or centuries ago) that still take effect today. Everyone encounters stereotype threat in some or form each day, however it can certainly effect some more than others. </p>

      <p>I certainly experienced much stereotype threat during my college years, and in many ways still deal with some of the same issues today. Similar to the results Dr. Steele&apos;s study, my academic performance suffered the first two years due to stereotype threat. I remember developing somewhat of an inferiority complex in the classroom toward my white peers that was virtually non-existent growing up. It was not until I completely left the country that I recognized this psychological shift. While studying abroad in Japan, the only course I took that was taught in English and had a non-Japanese professor was an economics course, which consisted of two white students, my white professor, and I. I remember feeling extremely intimidated the first few class sessions, however, by the end of the semester I realized that my fear of conforming to negative stereotypes of black intelligence in a white male dominated environment had stifled my performance in the classroom. This was a significant epiphany that allowed me to approach my life with newfound confidence. I returned school my final year achieved the highest grades of my college career with an approach that was more confident, at ease, and less stressful.</p>

      <p>In this particular case, my realization that I was experiencing stereotype threat (I had no clue that there was a term for it at the time) allowed me unlock my full potential in many aspects of my life. It wasn&apos;t necessarily that I realized that I was equal to my white male counter parts, but more so how one can both actively and subconsciously allow stereotypes of identity to hinder personal growth. The epiphany better equipped me to combat stereotype threat. </p>

      <p>This is only one type of stereotype threat that I&apos;ve faced in my life, my personal solution to the phenomena is a complex one. In order to prevent stereotype threat from affecting your performance in school or in the workplace and career decisions, the first step would be to recognize and come to terms with how it has previously affected you if at all. Essentially you must realize that any doubts you may have about your own capabilities or your ability to do anything are fabricated. You will accomplish your goals as long as you stay diligent and confident in your ability to master anything or any path you may take. However, the most psychologically impactful instances of stereotype threat are those that are threatening to the individual; you feel as though you can be judged, criticized, or physically harmed if you fit a certain stereotype. For instance, a Black man may avoid certain articles of clothing and conduct himself in a certain way in different settings for fear of being viewed as dangerous or a woman may choose to wear certain attire to avoid being seen as promiscuous. I believe that in situations like these, stereotype threat develops into frustrating and limiting defense mechanisms that may or may not protect the individual.</p>
