          <h1>The Rise of a Juggernaut</h1>
          <img id="single" src="../imgs/Javascript.png"/>
          <p>For this week&apos;s technical series, I will be exploring the rise of one of web development&apos;s most prominent languages; JavaScript. Ever since its inception in the mid 90&apos;s, JavaScript has become a top language due to its ease of use, and ability to deliver rich, dynamic web content. In 1995, Brendan Eich created JavaScript as a lightweight complement to Java (after many name changes, they decided to go with JavaScript in order to ride the rising the popularity of Java). However, no new language can survive let alone succeed by employing such marketing strategies; any new language must fulfill an emerging computing need.</p>

          <p>For JavaScript, that need manifested in the form of Netscape Navigator, which was a dominant browser in the 90&apos;s in direct competition with Microsoft. JavaScript was its main language, providing dynamic front-end development. Since then, JavaScript has dramatically expanded into new domains such as mobile and cloud, accumulating millions of developers along the way. Although it has its issues (every language does), its rise to prominence can be attributed to its flexibility; JavaScript is easily learned and can be used to accomplish many things without much expertise on the language. This makes the case for JavaScript as a very strong language.  As a result, companies such as Microsoft, Google, GM, Yahoo, Dow Jones, and Apple have all leveraged its vast potential to achieve a plethora of tasks.</p>
          <p>Ultimately JavaScript is a simple, open language that can be adapted to building both client and server-side applications.</p>
