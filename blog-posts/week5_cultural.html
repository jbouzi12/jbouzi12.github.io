      <p>It is now 5 weeks into Phase-0 of my DBC journey and I must say that it has been a tremendous experience thus far. Iâ€™ve learned more in these past few weeks than I would have in a few months on my own. In addition to being introduced to HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Ruby, a big proponent of DBC is pair work and feedback. We are all required to pair with another student each week and administer feedback after every pairing session. Since web development and other careers in tech are very collaborative (contrary to popular belief), this is an imperative aspect of DBC.</p>

      <p>Pairing has been interesting experience thus far; at times I find myself learning a lot from my pair and solve challenges that would have taken much longer individually, but sometimes challenges take much longer with a pair than if I&apos;d completed it by myself. This is mainly due to each student&apos;s differing skill levels, and in truth is expected since we are all at the beginning stages of our learning process. Pairing has been a productive experience, especially since I enjoy learning from others and completing tasks efficiently.  Optimizing my pairing skills to an ideal is still a work in progress, as I find that some assignments tend to take longer than they should. Thus, as I continue my DBC experience I&apos;ll leverage the feedback I receive in order to cultivate more efficient pairing sessions.</p>

      <p>Pairing feedback tends to be based upon your performance as a collaborator and your ability to learn as opposed to your coding capabilities (to a certain extent). I respect and value when other students earnestly critique my performance and especially my code. Receiving constructive criticism can tough at times, however, I&apos;ve come to truly appreciate my most critical feedback. In many instances I adopted other students&apos; advice, resulting in much more efficient code as well as a more fluid pairing experience.  One of the most important pieces of feedback I&apos;ve received thus far was that at times I may require some probing before I voice my opinion on the code. This was crucial because I sometimes tend to fall back and let others assume a leadership role and would step up only when things seemed to go astray. This advice made me realize that my partners need and value my input just as much as I do theirs, so I must constantly communicate my thoughts and ideas in order to improve the dynamic of the pairing session. Writing excellent feedback has been somewhat of a juggling act. I can honestly say that I can sometimes come across as harsh when giving constructive criticism to loved ones, so I constantly strive to construct criticism that is actionable and positive. Administering pairing feedback has helped this process and stimulated growth in this regard. </p>
