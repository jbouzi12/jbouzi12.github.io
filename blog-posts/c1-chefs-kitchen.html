        <p>Before beginning my Dev Bootcamp experience, I never truly sat down and contemplated how rigorous my upcoming experience will be. I typically try to set high goals for my self, create a flexible plan of action, and attempt to execute no matter the difficulty. If I have a goal in mind or if I want a certain type of experience I honestly do not care how challenging it may be. As a result I tend to not think about the gravity of such challenges; I&apos;m not sure if this could be potentially bad in the future, but I&apos;d like to think that this trait allows me to dive head first into challenges and really push myself to the best of my abilities.<p>Now enter Dev Bootcamp. Since beginning Phase-0 of the program I am slowly beginning to realize that this experience I am embarking upon may prove to be one of the most challenging journeys of my life. Yet, I can&apos; even fathom what I will be able to accomplish as I take each step, closer and close to my goal of becoming a dynamic developer. I try not to think about Dev Bootcamp through the eyes of a consumer: I&apos;m paying to learn various coding languages and eventually get a cool job. I am more concerned with what I will be able to accomplish and developing my ability to transform ideas into innovative products.</p>

        <p>Despite my excitement, I would be lying if I said that I was not worried. My greatest concern is falling behind amidst such a fast-paced, dynamic environment. However, I am comforted by the fact that I will be able to receive guidance from amazing professors as well as my cohort-mates, many of which already offer much support in our Google community. Hopefully, I will be able to thrive amidst the chaos and contribute to the cultivation of innovative ideas with my peers.</p>
