      <h1>My Thinking Style</h1>
        <p>Order and randomness hardly seem like two concepts that can be combined into one entity. However, the human mind is extremely complex and capable of the most magnificent feats. When researching my thinking style, I never would have anticipated my thought process implementing both. According to Gregoric&apos; mind styles model, my thinking style is two-fold; abstract random (AR) and abstract sequential (AS). Now lets unpack this…</p>

        <p>The abstract perceptual quality, as opposed to concrete, allows you to visualize and conceive ideas, and to use your imagination and intuition in order to see what cannot actually be seen. The sequential ordering ability allows your mind to organize information linearly, following a logical train of thought; the random ordering ability on the other hand allows your mind to organize information in chunks with no particular order, often giving one the ability to skip steps in a task yet still get the desired outcome, and start virtually anywhere within a procedure (even working backwards). It&apos;s intriguing to discover that many of these qualities strongly resonate with me: I must break down my thoughts/information in order to fully understand, yet am able to skip steps or start at very random places yet still solve a problem. This has definitely been in many aspects of my life, and allowed me to learn things very quickly, often only needing one or two demonstrations in order to figure it out. </p>
        <p>Things become even more interesting when researching the characteritics of an AS and AR thinker. As an AS thinker, I like analyzing situations before making decisions, having access to experts of references, and being placed in stimulating environments, yet find it difficult to have little time to deal with a subject thoroughly, and being forced to work with those of differing views. These qualities seem too accurate, and over the past few years I’ve been developing my ability to work with others with different organizational levels as myself. However, my qualities as an AR thinker seem to add balance to some of my negative AS traits: I like to listen to others, bring harmony to group situations, and participate in group activities, yet have difficulty having to explain or justify feelings, concentrating on one thing at a time, and accepting even positive criticism. I believe that these are all very accurate, and some have been apparent at DBC thus far.</p>
        <p>Over these first 3 weeks at DBC, I found that many of the strengths I pertaining to my thinking style have helped me to have a relatively smooth experience thus far. I’ve been able to pick up the material, at times fairly quickly, and enjoyed my pairing sessions. Due to the abundant time I have to work with the material, the organized nature of our curriculum, and very friendly and eager to learn cohort members, it the transition into Phase-0 has been positive. However, I know that Phase-1 will be an entirely new beast, as I will be working on much more extensive assignments and collaborating face-to-face with fellow students. I believe that this environment will bring out some of my strengths, yet really test some of my weaknesses. In general I&apos;s become really accustomed to working around my weaknesses. As a result they only become apparent in certain circumstances. I believe that Phases 1 through 3 will provide a space for me to confront many of these deficiencies.</p>
